# Underwater-Image-reconstruction-
The reconstruction of underwater image based on compressive sensing (CS) and image registration (IR)

This project is the support of article
"A two-stage restoration of distorted underwater images using compressive sensing and image registration" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40436-020-00340-z)

This project consists of two parts: gray underwater image restoration and color underwater image restoration

How to run?

1.Put all resources in one folder

2.open "Registration_cs_guidedfilter.m" or "Registration_cs_guidedfilter_color.m"

3.set path to add the distorted datasets, change function "viariable_init" to set the size of lucky patches fusion and set the name of outfile

4.run and check your results
